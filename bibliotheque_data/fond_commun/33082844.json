Considered an eccentric, he was the leader of the\naesthetic movement that advocated “art for art's sake” and was\nonce imprisoned for two years with hard labor for homosexual\npractices. The Nightingale and the Rose (1888) - A fairy tale about\na nightingale who presses her breast against a thorn until a rose is\nborn.\n\n2\nTHE NIGHTINGALE AND THE ROSE\n\"She said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,”\ncried the young Student; “but in all my garden there is no red\nrose.\" From her nest in the holm-oak tree the Nightingale heard\nhim, and she looked out through the leaves, and wondered.\n\"No red rose in all my garden!” he cried, and his beautiful eyes\nfilled with tears. “Ah, on what little things does happiness depend!\nI have read all that the wise men have written, and all the secrets of\nphilosophy are mine, yet for want of a red rose is my life made\nwretched.\" \"Here at last is a true lover,\" said the Nightingale.\n\"Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not;\nnight after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see\nhim. His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red\nas the rose of his desire; but passion has made his face like pale\nivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow.” “The Prince\ngives a ball to-morrow night,” murmured the young Student, “and\nmy love will be of the company. If I bring her a red rose she will\ndance with me till dawn. If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in\nmy arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her\nhand will be clasped in mine. But there is no red rose in my\ngarden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by. She will have\nno heed of me, and my heart will break.”\n“Here indeed is the true lover,” said the Nightingale. “What I sing\nof, he suffers: what is joy to me, to him is pain. Surely Love is a\nwonderful thing. It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer\nthan fine opals. Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set\nforth in the market-place. It may not be purchased of the\nmerchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold.” “The\nmusicians will sit in their gallery,\" said the young Student, “and\nplay upon their stringed instruments, and my love will dance to\nthe sound of the harp and the violin. She will dance so lightly that\nher feet will not touch the floor, and the courtiers in their gay\ndresses will throng around her. But with me she will not dance, for\nI have no red rose to give her\"; and he flung himself down on the\ngrass, and buried his face in his hands, and wept.\n\"Why is he weeping?\" asked a little Green Lizard, as he ran past\nhim with his tail in the air.\n\"Why, indeed?\" said a Butterfly, who was fluttering about after a\nsunbeam.\n\n3\n\"Why, indeed?\" whispered a Daisy to his neighbour, in a soft, low\nvoice.\n\"He is weeping for a red rose,” said the Nightingale.\n\"For a red rose!\" they cried; “how very ridiculous!\" and the little\nLizard, who was something of a cynic, laughed outright.\nBut the Nightingale understood the secret of the Student's sorrow,\nand she sat silent in the oak-tree, and thought about the mystery of\nLove.\nSuddenly she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into\nthe air. She passed through the grove like a shadow, and like a\nshadow she sailed across the garden.\nIn the centre of the grass-plot was standing a beautiful Rose-tree,\nand when she saw it, she flew over to it, and lit upon a spray.\n“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest\nsong.\" But the Tree shook its head.\n“My roses are white,” it answered; “as white as the foam of the sea,\nand whiter than the snow upon the mountain. But go to my brother\nwho grows round the old sun-dial, and perhaps he will give you\nwhat you want.” So the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that\nwas growing round the old sun-dial.\n“Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest\nsong.\" But the Tree shook its head.\n\"My roses are yellow,” it answered; “as yellow as the hair of the\nmermaiden who sits upon an amber throne, and yellower than the\ndaffodil that blooms in the meadow before the mower comes with\nhis scythe. But go to my brother who grows beneath the Student's\nwindow, and perhaps he will give you what you want.\"\nSo the Nightingale flew over to the Rose-tree that was growing\nbeneath the Student's window.\n\"Give me a red rose,” she cried, “and I will sing you my sweetest\nsong.\" But the Tree shook its head.\n\"My roses are red,” it answered; “as red as the feet of the dove, and\nredder than the great fans of coral that wave and wave in the ocean\ncavern. But the winter has chilled my veins, and the frost has\nnipped my buds, and the storm has broken my branches, and I\nshall have no roses at all this year.” “One red rose is all I want,\"\ncried the Nightingale. “Only one red rose! Is there any way by\nwhich I can get it?” “There is a way,” answered the Tree; “but it is\nso terrible that I dare not tell it to you.” “Tell it to me,\" said the\n\n4\nNightingale, “I am not afraid.\" \"If you want a red rose,” said the\nTree, “you must build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it\nwith your own heart's-blood. You must sing to me with your\nbreast against a thorn. All night long you must sing to me, and the\nthorn must pierce your heart, and your life-blood must flow into\nmy veins, and become mine.” “Death is a great price to pay for a\nred rose,” cried the Nightingale, “and Life is very dear to all. It is\npleasant to sit in the green wood, and to watch the Sun in his\nchariot of gold, and the Moon in her chariot of pearl. Sweet is the\nscent of the hawthorn, and sweet are the bluebells that hide in the\nvalley, and the heather that blows on the hill. Yet Love is better\nthan Life, and what is the heart of a bird compared to the heart of a\nman?\" So she spread her brown wings for flight, and soared into\nthe air. She swept over the garden like a shadow, and like a\nshadow she sailed through the grove.\nThe young Student was still lying on the grass, where she had left\nhim, and the tears were not yet dry on his beautiful eyes.\n\"Be happy,\" cried the Nightingale, \"be happy; you shall have your\nred rose. I will build it out of music by moonlight, and stain it with\nmy own heart's-blood.\nAll that I ask of you in return is that you will be a true lover, for\nLove is wiser than Philosophy, though she is wise, and mightier\nthan Power, though he is mighty. Flame-coloured are his wings,\nand coloured like flame is his body. His lips are sweet as honey,\nand his breath is like frankincense.” The Student looked up from\nthe grass, and listened, but he could not understand what the\nNightingale was saying to him, for he only knew the things that\nare written down in books.\nBut the Oak-tree understood, and felt sad, for he was very fond of\nthe little nightingale who had built her nest in his branches.\n\"Sing me one last song,\" he whispered; “I shall feel very lonely\nwhen you are gone.\"\nSo the Nightingale sang to the Oak-tree, and her voice was like\nwater bubbling from a silver jar.\nWhen she had finished her song the Student got up, and pulled a\nnote-book and a lead-pencil out of his pocket.\n\"She has form,” he said to himself, as he walked away through the\ngrove, “that cannot be denied her; but has she got feeling? I am\nafraid not. In fact, she is like most artists; she is all style, without\nany sincerity. She would not sacrifice herself for others. She thinks\n\n5\nmerely of music, and everybody knows that the arts are selfish.\nStill, it must be admitted that she has some beautiful notes in her\nvoice. What a pity it is that they do not mean anything, or do any\npractical good.\" And he went into his room, and lay down on his\nlittle pallet-bed, and began to think of his love; and, after a time, he\nfell asleep.\nAnd when the Moon shone in the heavens the Nightingale flew to\nthe Rosetree, and set her breast against the thorn. All night long\nshe sang with her breast against the thorn, and the cold, crystal\nMoon leaned down and listened. All night long she sang, and the\nthorn went deeper and deeper into her breast, and her lifeblood\nebbed away from her.\nShe sang first of the birth of love in the heart of a boy and a girl.\nAnd on the topmost spray of the Rose-tree there blossomed a\nmarvellous rose, petal followed petal, as song followed song. Pale\nwas it, as first, as the mist that hangs over the river- pale as the feet\nof the morning, and silver as the wings of the dawn. As the\nshadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, as the shadow of a rose in a\nwater-pool, so was the rose that blossomed on the topmost spray of\nthe Tree.\nBut the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the\nthorn. \"Press closer, little Nightingale,” cried the Tree, “or the Day\nwill come before the rose is finished.” So the Nightingale pressed\ncloser against the thorn, and louder and louder grew her song, for\nshe sang of the birth of passion in the soul of a man and a maid.\nAnd a delicate flush of pink came into the leaves of the rose, like\nthe flush in the face of the bridegroom when he kisses the lips of\nthe bride. But the thorn had not yet reached her heart, so the rose's\nheart remained white, for only a Nightingale's heart's-blood can\ncrimson the heart of a rose.\nAnd the Tree cried to the Nightingale to press closer against the\nthorn. “Press closer, little Nightingale,” cried the Tree, “or the Day\nwill come before the rose is finished.\" So the Nightingale pressed\ncloser against the thorn, and the thorn touched her heart, and a\nfierce pang of pain shot through her. Bitter, bitter was the pain, and\nwilder and wilder grew her song, for she sang of the Love that is\nperfected by Death, of the Love that dies not in the tomb.\nAnd the marvellous rose became crimson, like the rose of the\neastern sky.\nCrimson was the girdle of petals, and crimson as a ruby was the\nheart.\n\n6\nBut the Nightingale's voice grew fainter, and her little wings began\nto beat, and a film came over her eyes. Fainter and fainter grew her\nsong, and she felt something choking her in her throat.\nThen she gave one last burst of music. The White Moon heard it,\nand she forgot the dawn, and lingered on in the sky. The red rose\nheard it and it trembled all over with ecstasy, and opened it petals\nto the cold morning air. Echo bore it to her purple cavern in the\nhills, and woke the sleeping shepherds from their dreams. It\nfloatcd through the reeds of the river, and they carried its message\nto the sea.\n\"Look, look!\" cried the Tree, “the rose is finished now\"; but the\nNightingale made no answer, for she was lying dead in the long\ngrass, with the thorn in her heart.\nAnd at noon the Student opened his window and looked out.\n“Why, what a wonderful piece of luck!\" he cried; “here is a red\nrose! I have never seen any rose like it in all my life. It is so\nbeautiful that I am sure it has a long Latin name\"; and he leaned\ndown and plucked it.\nThen he put on his hat, and ran up to the Professor's house with\nthe rose in his hand.\nThe daughter of the Professor was sitting in the doorway winding\nblue silk on a reel, and her little dog was lying at her feet.\n\"You said that you would dance with me if I brought you a red\nrose,” cried the Student. “Here is the reddest rose in all the world.\nYou will wear it to-night next your heart, and as we dance together\nit will tell you how I love you.\" But the girl frowned.\n\"I am afraid it will not go with my dress,” she answered; \"and,\nbesides, the Chamberlain's nephew has sent me some real jewels,\nand everybody knows that jewels cost far more than flowers.\"\n\"Well, upon my word, you are very ungrateful,\" said the Student,\nangrily; and he threw the rose into the street, where it fell into the\ngutter, and a cartwheel went over it.\n\"Ungrateful!\" said the girl. “I tell you what, you are very rude;\nand, after all, who are you? Only a Student. Why, I don't believe\nyou have even got silver buckles to your shoes as the\nChamberlain's nephew has\"; and she got up from her chair and\nwent into the house.\n\"What a silly thing Love is,” said the Student as he walked away.\n“It is not half as useful as Logic, for it does not prove anything, and\nit is always telling one of things that are not going to happen, and\n\n7\nmaking one believe things that are not true. In fact, it is quite\nunpractical, and, as in this age to be practical is everything, I shall\ngo back to Philosophy and study Metaphysics.\"\nSo he returned to his room and pulled out a great dusty book, and\nbegan to read.\n\n**THE END**",
